# BAMAZON 
 
Bamzon is a command line interface designed to be a virtual store, similar to Amazon.com.  Items can be purchased from either the Electronics or Bio-engineered Animals departments. Records are stored in a mySql backend and are persistant inbeween program launches. SQL schema and seed files are provided to populate the database.

# Getting Started
To run the program, first install the correct dependencies with npm. A package.json file is supplied.


# Prerequisites
Node.js must be installed on machine. See https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for instructions.

# Overview
Please see the homework instructions for full installation requirements. Once installed, the following commands are recognized:

# Deployment
Navigate to https://github.com/aaaronmiller/bamazon.git to clone.

# Built With
Visual Studio Code, Node.JS and mySQL

# Versioning
We use github for version control (https://github.com/your/project/tags).

# In development
Currently the application only sells one item at a time, as I created the program based on the readme file for the unit, and did not see the detailed homework instructions deeper within the directory structure. The only functinal difference however is that currently only one item is available for purchase at a time, instead of a prompt allowing multiple item purchases.
Cli-table and chalk would be a nice addition to add a more visually appealing interface, and would be the first additional feature if more time were to be spent on the project. Completion of the administrator and manager interfaces would also add extra functionality, but essentially operates in the same way that the primary executable does.
